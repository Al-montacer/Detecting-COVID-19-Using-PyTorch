# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray Using PyTorch

## Project Overview
This GitHub repository is dedicated to a deep learning project aimed at detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. We use the PyTorch framework to develop an image classification model that distinguishes between Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases based on chest X-ray scans.

## Dataset
Our dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). It includes nearly 3000 chest X-ray scans categorized into three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust image classification model using PyTorch. This model aims to accurately classify chest X-ray scans into one of the three categories. Our current metrics are as follows:
- **Evaluation Step**: 100
- **Validation Loss**: 0.1557
- **Accuracy**: 96.67%

## Technologies and Libraries
In this project, we utilize various technologies and libraries, including:
- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library for developing the classification model.
- **torchvision**: A PyTorch package providing access to datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision.
- **NumPy**: Essential for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image file operations.
- **Matplotlib**: To plot graphs and display images.

## Important Disclaimer
Please note that the dataset and the model we develop are for educational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis of COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia.

## Collaboration
This project was developed in collaboration with Amit Yadav, whose expertise in deep learning and computer vision was invaluable.
